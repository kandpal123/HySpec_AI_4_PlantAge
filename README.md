# HySpec_AI_4_PlantAge
|Explored the estimation methods of different machine learning models for plant age discrimination using hyperspectral remote sensing data|

This (HySpec_AI_4_PlantAge) package will be useful for the age identification of a Himalayan medicinal plant _Valeriana jatamansi_ using hyperspectral reflectance data and various machine learning models. You can also apply these models in your datasets for other plants. 

Datasets:
Plants of _Valeriana jatamansi_ belonging to 04 different age groups viz. 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months were selected. Spectral data recording was carried out for each age group of _Valeriana jatamansi_. Spectra of each plant individuals were recorded using ASD handheld Spectroradiometer (325 to 1075 nm with 1.4 nm scanning interval) in the wavelength ranges representing visible and NIR regions
